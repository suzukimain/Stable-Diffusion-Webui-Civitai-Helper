## About This Version of Webui Helper
This is my personal version of Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper. I started it entirely because the version I was using broke when SD-webui v1.5 came out and I needed it to work. Since then, I have added functionality that I wanted and have made best-effort attempts to maintain compatibility with older versions of sd-webui, but I do not use older versions and therefore do not test on older versions.

I intend to keep this working for as long as I am able, but this is simply a hobby project and I am nowhere near as skilled as other extension developers with more experience. I am likely to dip out for long periods at a time, possibly forever if I lose interest. I am prone to errors and bugs are to be expected.

If a more interested part decides to pick up development, I will happily cede control of this project and attempt to push my changes to their projects if they are wanted.

# Civitai Helper
Stable Diffusion Webui Extension for Civitai, to handle your models much more easily.

Civitai: ![Civitai Url](https://civitai.com/models/16768/civitai-helper-sd-webui-civitai-extension)

# Features
* Scans all models to download model information and preview images from Civitai.
* Link local model to a civitai model by civitai model's url
* Download a model(with info and preview) by Civitai Url into SD's model folder or subfolders.
* Downloading can be resumed if an issue occurs, which is good for large files.
* Checking all your local models for new versions from Civitai
* Download a new version directly into SD model folder (with info and preview)
* Modified Built-in "Extra Network" cards, to add the following buttons on each card:
  - üñºÔ∏è: Modified "replace preview" text into this icon
  - üåê: Open this model's Civitai url in a new tab
  - üí°: Add this model's trigger words to prompt
  - ‚úèÔ∏è: Rename model
  - ‚ùå: Remove/Delete model
* Option to always show additional buttons, to help with touchscreens.
* To the best of my knowledge, this extension should still work in versions of webui prior to v1.5.0, but it is not tested. I make best-effort attempts to write code that *should* maintain compatibility with older versions, but if you have run into problems, please file an issue and I'll attempt to resolve it.
* **New feature**: Automatically add metadata of model resources used to all generated images. Useful for uploading to Civitai. More information below.

# Install
Go to SD webui's extension tab, go to `Install from url` sub-tab.
Copy this project's url into it, click install.

Alternatively, download this project as a zip file, and unzip it to `Your SD webui folder/extensions`.

Everytime you install or update this extension, you need to shutdown SD Webui and Relaunch it. Just "Reload UI" won't work for this extension.

Some functionality from Civitai, like downloading models, requires having an account and adding your API key. See this ![Wiki Article](https://github.com/zixaphir/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper/wiki/Civitai-API-Key) for more information.

Done.

## Branches
Development of this extension happens in three development branches:
* **`master`**: The current version of the extension intended for end users. Out-of-version changes to this branch only exist to hotfix critical issues found after the release of a new version.
* **`dev`**: The active development version of this extension. This will always have the most up-to-date changes but is also the most likely to contain bugs.
* **`v1.6ONLY`**: Not supported and not really intended for anybody except for me. Slowest to update and less tested than other branches, this branch only runs on the latest version of webui. Compatibility code for older versions is actively removed, and whether I'm running it on webui stable or webui dev is in flux. In theory, this is the most optimized version of the extension, but it's often just me chasing waterfalls. Do not submit issues if you use this branch. They will be marked as invalid, closed, and otherwise ignored.
* **`Feature Branches`**: These are branches separated from the main development branches to add new features. They are likely to be in a state of active development and incomplete.

## Update Your SD Webui
This extension need to get extra network's cards id. Which is added since **2023-02-06**.
**If your SD webui is an earlier version, you need to update it!**

### Some of the following information may not up-to-date. Most functionality should be the same or similar, but many changes post-v1.6 have not been documented as of yet. Images may not match 1:1 with the current state of the extension.

## Scanning Models
Go to extension tab "Helper". There is a button called "Scan model".

![](img/extension_tab.jpg)

Click it and the extension will scan all your models to generate SHA256 hashes, using them to retreive model information and preview images from Civitai.

**Scanning takes time, just wait until it finish**

For each model, it will create two files to save all model info from Civitai. These model info files will be `[model_name].civitai.info` and `[model_name].json` in your model folder.

![](img/model_info_file.jpg)

If a model info file already exists, by default it will be skipped. If a model cannot be found in Civitai, a minimal model info file will be created with any information that can be extracted from the model. By default, a model with model pre-existing model info files will not be scanned.

### Adding New Models
When you want to grab some new models, you can either download them to the appropriate directory yourself or you can use the built-in model [downloader](https://github.com/zixaphir/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper#download). If you use the Model Downloader, the model information and preview will also be downloaded, along providing the option to download other files, like the model config or VAE.

If you just want to download the models into the appropriate directories yourself, you can simply run a scan again to get new model's information and preview images, although other files like the model config or VAE may be missing. Only new models will be scanned with default options.

### Update Image Generation Information
In the same place you can scan a model, you can also scan the model info and the extension will attempt to fill in any missing information from the images themselves. This is a very hit-or-miss process, but if you are trying to get the prompt from an image  the "preview image prompt" button and it fails to work, performing this scan may retrieve the information necessary to fix it.

### Automatic Generated Image Metadata
Automatically adds metadata to any image you generate using the data from `[model_name].civitai.info`. The metadata added closely matches images generated on Civitai's on-site generator. This will make the website automatically detect and link all resources used.
Just make sure you scan after downloading any new models.

For the on-site detector to work correctly, you will need to disable the default added resource hashes.

**Disable the following settings:**
* Stable Diffusion -> Extra Networks -> Add Textual Inversion hashes to infotext
* Stable Diffusion -> Extra Networks -> Add Lora hashes to infotext
* User Interface -> Infotext -> Add model hash to infotext
* User Interface -> Infotext -> Add VAE hash to infotext

The above settings must be disabled so the Civitai site does not get confused with incorrect hashes.

## Model Card

### The following section is outdated!
The following text block and image only applies to Stable Diffution Webui versions before v1.5.0. While the added buttons are still up-to-date, the "Extra Networks" tab button has been removed and is now always active by default.

---

**(Use this only after scanning finished)**
Open SD webui's build-in "Extra Network" tab, to show model cards.

![](img/extra_network.jpg)


Move your mouse on to the bottom of a model card. It will show 4 icon buttons:
  - üñº: Replace preview (a build-in button, modified from text to icon)
  - üåê: Open this model's Civitai url in a new tab
  - üí°: Add this model's trigger words to prompt
  - üè∑: Use this model's preview image's prompt
  - ‚úèÔ∏è: Rename model
  - ‚ùå: Remove/Delete model

![](img/model_card.jpg)

## Webui Metadata Editor
As of v1.7.0, this extension also downloads data for Webui's Metadata Editor by default. This data includes information you'd previously have to read unruly JSON files or navigate to Civitai to read.

![](img/webui_metadata_editor.png)

This data can be accessed by clicking the metadata button on the model card.

![](img/webui_metadata_button.png)

## Download
To download a model by Civitai Model Page's Url, you need 3 steps:
* Fill the Civitai URL or Model ID
* Click "Get Model Info by Civitai Url.
* It will fill in the details automatically, but you can change several options if you need to, including the model version, which subfolder to download the model to, and which optional files to download with the model, if any.
  * If you need to add more sub-folders, you must do this by navigating to the model directory on the system running your webui version.
* Click download.

![](img/download_section.png)

Detail will be displayed on console log, with a progress bar.
Downloading can be resumed on failure, so no fear of having to restart large files.

## Checking Model's New Version
You can checking your local model's new version from civitai by model types. You can select multiple model types.

![](img/check_model_new_version.jpg)

The checking process has a small delay after each model's new version checking request. So it is a little slow.

This is to protect Civitai from issue like DDos from this extension. There is no good for us if it is down.

**After checking process done**, it will display all new version's information on UI.

There are 3 urls for each new version.
* First one is model's civitai page.
* Second one is new version's download url.
* Third one is a button to download it into your SD's model folder with python.
With this one, output information is on "Download Model" section's log and console log. **One task at a time**.

![](img/check_model_new_version_output.png)

## Get Model Info By Url
This is used to force a local model links to a Civitai model. For example, you converted a model's format or pruned it. Then it can not be found on civitai when scanning.

In that case, if you still want to link it to a civitai model. You can use this funcion.

Choose this model from list, then offer a civitai model page's url.

After clicking button, extension will download that civitai model's info and preview image for the local file you picked.

![](img/get_one_model_info.jpg)

## Preview Image
Extra networks use both `model_file.png` and `model_file.preview.png` as preview image. But `model_file.png` has higher priority, because it is created by yourself.

When you don't have the higher priority one, it will use the other automatically. SD WebUI also supports other filetypes for previews but `.png` files will always have priority over every other filetype. For instance, `model_file.jpg` will supercede `model_file.preview.jpg` but not `model_file.preview.png`.

## Prompt
When you click the button "Use prompt from preview image", it does not use the prompt from your own preview image. It uses the one from civitai's preview image.

On civitai, a model's preview images may not has prompt. This extension will check this model's all civitai preview images' information and use the first one has prompt in it.

## SHA256
To create a file SHA256, it need to read the whole file to generate a hash code. It gonna be slow for large files.

Also, extension uses Memory Optimized SHA256, which won't stuck your system and works with colab.

There are 2 cases this hash code can not find the model on civitai:
* Some old models, which do not have SHA256 code on civitai.
* The model's owner changed file on civitai, but does not change version name and description. So, the file on civitai is actually not the one on your manchine.

In these cases, you can always link a model to civitai by filling its URL in this extension.


## Settings
While many options are provided in the Helper tab, a dedicated settings section can be found in WebUI's Setting's tab. Here you will find a variety of options that are either not available in the Helper tab or that can be set here so that they do not reset when you reload the page. For example, you can hide buttons added by the extension that you do not use, enable always showing buttons to make functionality more touch-screen friendly, or choose to download the highest resolution versions of preview images available.

The next couple sections explain some of the more advanced option.

### API Key
Some models on Civitai require you to be logged in to download them. Unfortunately, it is not currently possible to just enter in your login information with this extension, but with an API Key, you will still be able to download these models. For information on how to generate an API Key for your Civitai account, please see our **[wiki](https://github.com/zixaphir/Stable-Diffusion-Webui-Civitai-Helper/wiki/Civitai-API-Key)**.

### Proxy
You may set a proxy for the extension to use and then all requests to civitai will use the proxy.

For some sock5 proxies, you may need to enter it in the form "socks5h://xxxxx".

### Choosing a Hashing function
For the longest time, this extension used its own code for performing Hashng, or fingerprinting, of model files. While this worked fine, and was quite good, this implementation had a finicky history with colabs and lacked some useful features like saving generated hashes so that future scans wouldn't need to re-hash the file. While the old implementation is still available through this setting, currently the default setting is to simply let WebUI handle that functionality and benefit from the exceptional development happening over there.

### Lycoris Models
By default, models known as "Lycoris" are saved to their own directory, but you can also choose to instead download them to the Lora directory instead. For most end-user purposes, LyCoris models are functionally the same as Loras, so this may be benefical if you simply want everything in one place. However, some extensions previously required LyCoris models to have their own directory, so the default will continue to be to keep them in separate directories for compatibility reasons.

### Other Setting
* "Show Buttons on Thumb Mode" will turn on/off additional Buttons on thumbnail.
    * Thumbnail Mode was removed in v1.5.0 of webui.

## Feature Request
Feel free to submit feature requests, but pull requests are preferred.

Enjoy!

## Pull Requests
All pull requests should target the dev branch. For those who take a stab at the code, I apologize for the lack of consistency in coding style, naming, and other syntactical oddities. At some point, I intend to clean up the code and have everything pass linting, but we're not there yet.

## Common Issue
### Buttons on card didn't show
#### Localization
There was a Localization issue if you are not using English version of SD webui. This is fixed in the latest version of this extension. **Bilingual localization extension is supported by PR since v1.6.1.1.**

##### Using cloud based localization extension
Turn off cloud based localization extension, use normal localization extension.

#### Other case
First of all, make sure you clicked the refresh button in the Helper tab.

If issue is still there, then only reason is you are not using the latest SD webui. So, Make sure you updated it.

Your update could be failed if you have modified SD webui's file. You need to check git command's console log to make sure it is updated.

In many cases, git will just refuse to update and tell you there are some conflicts need you to handle manually. If you don't check the consloe log, you will think your SD webui is updated, but it is not.

### Request, Scan or Get model info failed
Usually the reason for this most likely is the connection to Civitai API service failed. This can be for a number of reasons.

Sometimes Civitai can be down or refuse your API connection. Civitai has a connection pool setting. Basicly, it's a max connection number that civitai can have at the same time. So if there are already too manny connections on civitai, it will refuse your API connection.

In those cases, the only thing you can do is just wait a while then try again. I suggest making a cup of tea!

### Get Wrong model info and preview images from civitai
A bad news is, some models are saved with a wrong sha256 in civitai's database. Check here for more detail:
[https://github.com/civitai/civitai/issues/426](https://github.com/civitai/civitai/issues/426)

So, for those models, this extension can not get the right model info or preview images.

In this case, you have to remove the model info file and get the right model info by a civitai url on this extension's tab page.

Also, you can report those models with wrong sha256 to civitai at following page:
[https://discord.com/channels/1037799583784370196/1096271712959615100/1096271712959615100](https://discord.com/channels/1037799583784370196/1096271712959615100/1096271712959615100)

Please report that model to civitai, so they can fix it.

### Scanning fail when using colab
First of, search your error message with google. Most likely, it will be a colab issue.

If you are sure it is a out of memory issue when scanning models, and you are using this extension's latest version, then there is nothing we can do.

Since v1.5.5, we've already optimized the SHA256 function to the top. So the only 2 choices for you are:
* try again
* or use a pro account of colab.
